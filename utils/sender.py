    TODO: Given an email template, an outgoing email address, an email signature, and possibly attachments:
    Define this function to properly send out thousands of emails, with CC and BCC functionality. 

    Do this while keeping track of which email address had emails sent to and which email address did not. We DO NOT
    want to spam our clients. 

    Make sure we don't get rate limited after a certain number of sent emails.
